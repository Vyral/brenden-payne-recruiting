<center><em>My business partner Greg and I discuss the real definition of courage.</em></center>

<br>Fear is something that exists in the minds of real estate agents and team leaders right now, and there’s no sense in denying it. Whenever there’s something in our society that we can’t control—like what’s happening with the stock market and the coronavirus—it eats away at people, but we must remember that fear itself acts sort of like a virus.

Instead of creating an environment in which it can flourish, we should create an environment of action and preparedness. What exactly does that look like in our industry though? That was the subject of a recent conversation between Greg Harrelson and I, which I’m excited to share.
