  There was a ton of great feedback on our recent video about the myths and
  scams that some agents are using to run their business. In it, I talked about
  how being a great agent has nothing to do with your personality, and I wanted
  to expand on that today. Although personality doesn’t play a huge factor,
  there are four things that do, and they will determine whether you will be a
  successful agent or not. To learn more, watch this short video.

<center><em>There are four things that all successful real estate agents need to have.</em></center>

<br>We got a ton of feedback recently on a video that my partner Greg Harrelson put out a few weeks back. The video was all about the myths and scams that agents are using to run their business, and one thing that people were curious about was my comment that being a great agent has nothing to do with your personality.

It’s certainly great to have one, but there’s no correlation between personality and someone who runs a successful real estate business. However, **there are four things that do matter and will make you a successful agent:**

**1\. Desire**. Nobody is getting anything in this business just because they show up. You’ll do a few deals here and there, but if you’re trying to build a real estate career and business, you have to have the desire to be a winner and the desire to excel.

**2\. Work ethic.** I know all kinds of people who come into this business and have the desire, but they didn’t have the work ethic in the beginning to get to the reward of being their own boss. That’s what everybody wants out of this business. It’s what I wanted too, but I didn’t realize the discipline that it took to get there.

**3\. Training.** Coaching and accountability are important as well. You can have the desire and the work ethic, but if you don’t have the training, you probably are not going to reach your full potential in this business. I’ve seen agents work themselves to the bone, but not excel because they lacked the skills, coaching, and mindset that you need to develop in this business.

**4\. Skills.** This is probably the No. 1 thing that most agents need to work on to unlock their full potential. Agents that are doing significantly more deals than you are right now are probably more skilled in the conversations their having. When they have more skills, they have more confidence. When they have more confidence, they do more deals and convert more prospects. When agents learn just enough to get by, they’re missing how the business can get really fun and really easy.

If you have any questions for me about how we can help you unlock your full potential as a real estate agent, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.<br>&nbsp;
