Takeaways + Tactics

* Clients are calling back the people they have the strongest connection with.
* The length of time between when you capture a lead and do business with them is a lot longer now, and a real connection will get you through that process.
* Donâ€™t focus on the length of conversations-- focus on asking questions.
* Scripts can be very helpful, as they are filled with questions that lead towards genuine connections.
