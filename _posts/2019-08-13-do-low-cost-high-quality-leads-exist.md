Getting low-cost, high-quality leads is the name of the game in real estate. You have to generate leads in order to do business.

There are three reasons agents fail to find low-cost, high-quality leads, and these reasons affect owners and brokers as well. Part of agents’ challenge is owners and brokers either passing on significant lead flow costs to their agents or just not providing any leads at all. The same reasons are behind either scenario.

Follow along in the video above as I outline the reasons keeping agents from getting low-cost, high-quality leads and how my team solves this problem. **For your convenience, I’ve provided timestamps so you can skip ahead to various sections:**
