At the start of the show, we discussed the various things that are distracting the consumer, and what it has to do with the news. Next, we discussed what would go wrong if the both the consumer and the agent are distracted. We also talked about the power of showing people that you really care, and that you want what is best for them. Towards the end of the show, we talked about how people attract business by treating people like they are already your clients.

We also discussed:

* How to get better at asking good questions and listening

* How distraction creates inactivity

**Distractions give people a sense of uncertainty.** When people feel uncertain, they tend not to make a lot of decisions. If the consumer’s distraction and inaction is coupled with the agent’s inactivity, this can have a huge impact on the market. As an agent, it is your job to limit distractions by having better conversations. In the face of a distractions, keep your client focused on their motivation. Remember: people’s motivation isn’t “to sell a house”, but to acquire the benefits that come along as a result of the sale. If you want to succeed in this distraction-laden market, decrease distraction in your interactions and increase your number of contacts.
