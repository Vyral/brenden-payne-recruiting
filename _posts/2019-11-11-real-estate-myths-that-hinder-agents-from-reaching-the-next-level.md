<center><em>Today we&rsquo;ll discuss the myths, lies, and scams that real estate agents are told that prevent them from getting to the next level in their business.</em></center>

<br>My business partner Greg Harrelson and I have spoken with many agents over the years in our efforts to attract them to our group and help them achieve top-level production. Many of those agents are brand-new licensees with no habits yet, and others came from other companies with habits that only enabled them to get to somewhere around 12 or 13 transactions before they hit a plateau. They just had no idea how to get to the next level.

Today, we had a conversation about those things that agents are told in their training processes that are either straight-up inaccurate or don’t align with the agents’ goals for their business. It seems like many brokers and managers in the business are only telling them what it takes to survive in the business, but nothing more than that.

**You can listen to our discussion in the video above to learn what myths, lies, and scams agents are being taught, how those misconceptions are preventing their growth, and what can be done to form productive business habits and mentalities that will ultimately take their business to the next level.**
