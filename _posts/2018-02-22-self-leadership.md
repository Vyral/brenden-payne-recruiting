We’re all leaders because we lead ourselves. Why do you have to be a good self-leader before you’re qualified to lead others effectively? What makes someone a great leader? **On this mini-episode, we talk about how to be a better leader, and the secret so few people know about leadership.**

**Takeaways + Tactics**

* You have to be an effective self-leader before you lead others because it gives you credibility.
* If you’re having trouble leading others, you have problems with self-leadership.
* You must be the example for other people to follow.  

A lot of people have a hard time attracting loyal followers because they weren’t followers themselves in the first place. They don’t lead themselves, and that makes it impossible for them to lead others. The truth about leadership is you become better by becoming a great learner, and a great player who follows a great coach. It all starts with you, so ask yourself if you’re a great follower of the things that you say and if you have integrity with the things you tell people do.
