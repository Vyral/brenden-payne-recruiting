You can choose who you work with. Finding which side best suits you, however, is a learning process.

Here’s a question a lot of agents ask themselves: **Should I be a buyer’s agent or a listing agent?**

Before you unintentionally pigeonhole yourself into one or the other, I’d like to break down the process of how to make the choice that works best for you.

Let’s start with a scenario that takes place in the beginning when you’re building your business as either a new licensee or as someone who’s already worked with buyers and listings. Regardless of which you are, there are some skill sets you want to learn.

**Focus on your conversation skills**. Like every industry, real estate has its own language for sales. The sooner you can learn the language of our business, the sooner you can communicate at a high level with both buyers and sellers. During this period, you want to be working with any client who is motivated to buy or sell. The goal here is to figure out communication and listening skills so you can determine your clients’ motivations more quickly.

**Through doing this, you’ll likely find yourself more comfortable with one side or the other**. However, even if you’re proficient with one, you may prefer to work with the other. If you enjoy both, you can help buyers and sellers alike. It all comes down to what you enjoy, who you enjoy helping, and where the proficiency lies in your skill set.

You don’t have to make a decision, but **you do have to be able to communicate**. Whether you’re helping a buyer or a seller, it’s the same conversation—you have to bring value, understand your market, and be able to communicate well with your clients.

If someone says you can only acquire a certain level of volume doing one or the other, **know that this is simply not true**. It’s all about your skills. By the time your business has grown and you’re handling more volume, the skill set will change to one of leadership ability. For now, don’t pin yourself down.

If you have any other questions, need further information, or have other topics you’d like me to cover, feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
