<center><em>Our late July webinar will cover many topics. Here&rsquo;s a peek at one of them.</em></center>

<br>Today I’m sharing a sneak peek at what Greg Harrelson and I are going to cover in our webinar at the end of July: How to get momentum for the second half of the year to ensure you hit your goals. Listings are the name of the game in this business. One of the challenges of the type of market we’re in is finding inventory because it’s a tight seller’s market; competition is fierce for listings. Even though there are plenty of people who want to sell, there are way more buyers than sellers in the market right now. If you can find listings, you’ll have sales.

**Four points we’ll cover on this topic:**

1. What’s different about a strong listing presentation, and what you need to know to win more clients
2. Where to find potential sellers
3. How to sell homes in the current market (It’s not always as easy as it seems)
4. What top real estate agents are doing to ensure they don’t get bogged down with all the extra stuff that comes with selling a house

We’re looking forward to going through this topic and many more with you on both the listing and buying sides of real estate. We’ll be sharing a ton of valuable information.
