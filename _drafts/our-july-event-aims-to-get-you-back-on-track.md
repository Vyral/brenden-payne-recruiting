With everything going on in the real estate industry and world at large, my business partner Greg Harrelson and I have really stepped up the amount of coaching we’re doing for our agents, and we’ve shared some of those insights with you.

As we head into the second half of the year, people are wondering how they can finish the year strong and, more importantly, build back the momentum they lost. That’s why **I want to introduce a program that we’ll be leading at the end of this month**; it’s free of charge—all you have to do is register for it.

Over the next couple of weeks, I’ll share more details on some of the program’s topics, but I first want to share a little bit about where this idea came from. There’s some things happening right now as a result of COVID-19 that could alter the outcome of the rest of the year. Surprisingly, these conditions could actually make your 2020 better than you’d expect.

Think about what happens this time of year; usually, the kids are out of school, you’re juggling an increased workload, and maybe you’re even trying to squeeze in a vacation. All in all, it’s fair to say that summer can knock us out of our routine. **For the past 60 to 90 days, however, all of us have been shoved out of our normal routine by wild circumstances**. Sure, we’ve likely adopted a new routine fitting of the times, but things haven’t been ‘normal’ since the middle of March.

**It’s now the middle of the year, and we owe it to ourselves to start seriously thinking about how we can regain the momentum that’s been lost**. 2020 feels so different because &nbsp;it’s almost as if we’ve started the year twice; things were a little slow coming out of Christmas, but then they picked up quickly, only to be halted by COVID-19. Now, we’re once again experiencing a surge, and there must be a way for you to build up your business quickly to take advantage of it.

Why is it so important for you to gain momentum right now? Well, we’ve all been taught a very valuable lesson: Just because something looks a certain way today doesn’t mean it’ll be that way tomorrow. We need to build momentum quickly because we don’t know what the third and fourth quarters of 2020 will look like, and we haven’t a clue how 2021 will start off.

If we don’t get off the ground and start building steam, we’ll miss out on the opportunities that exist now. No matter what happens, you’ll always find opportunities as long as you’re looking for them.

Lastly, I want to help agents understand that **real estate doesn’t have to be a choice between getting everything you want from your business and actually having a life**. It’s not lifestyle versus business; you can enjoy both. Doing so, however, requires that you build up momentum quickly\!

Stay tuned, as we’ll be sending you more info over the coming weeks. The topics of our upcoming program will be the very same topics we coach our agents on daily. They’re types of things we discuss with agents who are doing anywhere from 40 to 100+ deals. If you’re not at that level of production, or if you’re not interested in that type of performance, don’t worry. These topics are designed to help anyone’s business. From mindset advice to technical tricks, you’ll learn things that can only be imparted from those who have produced at a high level.

Go ahead and register here. We look forward to seeing you at the end of the month, but in the meantime, you can always reach out to us via phone or email with any questions you may have\!
