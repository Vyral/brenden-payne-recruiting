<br>We just finished conducting business reviews with our agents for 2020, which helps them see where clients are coming from and set goals for the new year. During our discussions, we came across an important topic: why dabbling doesn’t work anymore in real estate.

Ten years ago, agents could have business coming from many different places. In recent years, though, real estate has changed. If you simply dabble in each pillar of your business, you won’t see the results you’d find in the past.

While it’s great to have multiple pipelines for business, you need to flesh each one out. In other cases, it may be better to scale back a bit and place your focus on one or two areas.

**Nowadays, consumers are getting more information than ever before**. Instead of you being a person’s sole agent, people can get information from dozens of different Realtors. If you aren’t staying on the top of your clients’ minds and aren’t adding value, you can easily fall by the wayside.

Another difference comes in how agents today are focusing on one thing instead of spreading themselves thin. Dabbling in many different areas means you aren’t investing yourself fully into anything. To fix this, you need to build out your pillars. In each pillar, the consumer needs to see you in multiple ways. For example, you should appear in their texts, emails, social media, and other outlets.

As you build out these pillars, you rise to the top of your consumers’ minds. **When they think about real estate, you want them to think of you**.

To find out where to focus your energy, it’s important to review where your business is coming from. Look at your pillars and find out where your strengths are. Continue your focus on areas where you see success, and build them up even more. When you find weak areas, you need to decide if you’d rather bolster them or stop them entirely. You may be better off putting effort into areas that you know are working well.

Regardless of which you choose, you’ll see better returns when you invest in your pillars of business. If you have any questions or would like more information, feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
