    Century 21 Expert Advisors is part of our Century 21 Harrelson Group Family.
    The Harrelson Group has been one of the Top Performing Real Estate Firms in
    the Southeast for years and we’re currently Ranked in the Top 10 offices
    within the entire Century 21 System.


    My Business Partner and original Real Estate Coach Greg Harrelson and I were
    consistently selling 150+ properties each year with our own teams, and we
    wanted to expand access to the systems and coaching opportunities that we
    know help agents grow their business. In 2014 we launched Century 21 Expert
    Advisors.


    We knew there was a niche of agents in the Charleston Market that we could
    serve. We set out to be the best solution for agents that are committed to
    reaching their financial goals by growing their business. Our goal will
    never be to have a 200 agent office. We want to know each one of our agents
    personally, so we can connect with their goals and help them achieve levels
    of success they never knew were possible. We also know that many times
    agents are lured into the smaller boutique offices because they don’t want
    to simply be another license # for the office they choose, but often times
    they find themselves sacrificing the systems and support with the smaller
    offices because with smaller operations it can be difficult for the
    ownership and management to re-invest in tools for their agents.


    We are committed to offering the best of both worlds to our agents. We’re a
    smaller close knit group where you get the family and team atmosphere, along
    with one on one coaching from our leadership team (including Greg and I).
    Better yet, because our office is part of The Harrelson Group Family we also
    offer world class technology, training, ongoing coaching and systems that
    you will not find with any other office in the Charleston Market that is our
    size. WE GUARANTEE IT!


    If you want to be more than a number in your office, if you want to grow
    YOUR BRAND, and YOUR NAME in this market instead of being on someone’s
    “TEAM” and helping make their dreams come true, or if you simply know you’re
    committed to being successful in this business and just haven’t found the
    right fit, let’s talk.
