<p>Dear Fellow or Future Real Estate Agent,</p>

<p>We understand that you may be frustrated right now with your current brokerage or place of work. Perhaps you feel as if you aren’t receiving much, if any, support in building the wealth and success you deserve. You might lack the training, coaching, and mentoring to get you there.</p>

<p><strong>The real estate industry as a whole has failed to provide agents with the coaching, systems, and resources necessary to build a career worth having.</strong> New agents are given a license and told to go make something happen without having the tools or guidance to assure they earn an acceptable income. They have no idea which direction to turn and often get tempted to follow all of the get-rich-quick products that are pushed on them with no success.</p>

<p>Have you noticed all the shiny objects that are presented to you on how to go build a business without putting in much effort? Or, have you been with a company that promised the world and delivered nothing and you are now having to figure out everything on your own? <strong>Our mission is to help our agents build a career worth having and our results show we can do just that.</strong></p>

<p>Going into real estate can feel either like the best or the worst career move you’ve ever made. So, how can you be sure that your real estate career won’t end in disaster? You join a quality brokerage—one with the right resources, training, and culture to help you grow as an agent.</p>

<p><strong>My name is Brendon Payne, and my partner, Greg Harrelson, and I have been passionately developing real estate top producers for 20+ years. Not only have we personally sold hundreds of properties per year, but we have also helped numerous agents sell 100, 200 and more properties per year by coaching them on the systems and strategies that it takes to build a great business. No matter what your goals are, whether it be 20 deals per year or 300, we have the experience and resources to get you there.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>I am looking for an agent that has the desire to take their business to the next level—an agent who knows they can do more but needs to be pointed in the right direction so they can reach their goals with less resistance. I am looking for an agent that wants to be a true professional, and someone who is competitive and is committed to doing things the right way.</p>

<p>There are companies that talk the great talk but have never walked the walk. Our resources, systems, and coaching programs have resulted in multiple 100+ deals per year producers making more income than they ever imagined. <strong>At any given time, you will see that we have more agents in the top 5, top 10 or top 50 producing agents in the marketplace than anybody else.</strong></p>

<p>We help our agents by teaching them a proven system that is predictable and duplicatable which leads to sustainability. We have the highest Per Person Production of any company or corporation in the marketplace…basically, our agents earn more net income.</p>

<p><strong>If you join our team, you’ll get:</strong>
<ul class="indent">
<li>A full CRM ($2400 Annual Value) </li>
<li>Buyer and seller leads throughout the month ($500 Monthly Value) </li>
<li>Infusionsoft Smart Drips ($3,000 Annual Value) </li>
<li>Production Coaching ($12,000 Annual Value)</li>
<li>An in-house Graphic Designer ($2000 Annual Value)</li>
<li>A Social Media Marketing Manager ($2400 Annual Value)</li>
<li>Access to our Chief Financial Advisor ($2000 Annual Value)</li>
</ul></p>

<p><strong>These resources will result in:</strong>
<ul class="indent">
<li>Having the software and the system to manage all your contacts so no opportunities fall through the cracks.</li>
<li>The ability to leverage our technology platforms to automate the sales process which gives you more free time and higher income.</li>
<li>The confidence to build your production knowing that you have top-level support and systems to manage your business.</li>
<li>Keeping your costs low and your profitability high because we are providing the resources so you do not have to spend the money yourself.</li>
</ul></p>

<p><strong>Without our systems, you could:</strong>
<ul class="indent">
<li>Work for a competing broker and go out on your own. But, you have to pay for all marketing, lead systems, office/desk space, etc.</li>
<li>Work for Century 21 as an independent agent.</li>
<li>Join a “new” team that is just starting and learning to set up the systems. The same systems and solutions we have had in place and are continually perfecting since 2001.</li>
<li>Try staying with your current brokerage and applying our concepts from scratch. But, why risk trying to replicate our success when you could simply join us?</li>
</ul></p>

<p><strong>If you like this plan, here’s a step-by-step look at what will happen when you apply:</strong>
<ol class="indent">
<li>We’re going to have a short phone conversation to make sure you’re a fit for this. </li>
<li>You’re going to attend one of my free workshops/training to write a business plan. </li>
<li>You’re going shadow a few agents for a day or so. </li>
<li>We will kick off our Fast Start Program in order to get you producing income quickly.</li>
<li>You will have access to our weekly coaching and boot camp training.</li>
<li>We will build out your profiles on our websites, build a website for you and connect you to our Social Media Manager.</li>
</ol></p>

<p><strong>I personally want to invite you to our company and share the blueprint for success that has been laid out and executed successfully by some of the top agents in the market.</strong></p>

<p>We would like to sit down with you and learn what you want to accomplish so we can build a business plan with you that meets your desires. We understand that the “One Size Fits All” strategy does not work, so we want to customize a plan that helps you reach your income and personal goals faster than imagined.</p>

<p>I guarantee you will experience more support, more training, and higher sales numbers while building a career worth having.</p>

<p>If you have any questions at all about this opportunity or about the real estate business in general, don’t hesitate to reach out to us today. We’re always here to answer your calls or emails. We look forward to hearing from you soon.</p>

<p>Regards,</p>

<p>Brendon Payne</p>

			<p>Century 21 Expert Advisors is part of our Century 21 Harrelson Group Family. The Harrelson Group has been one of the Top Performing Real Estate Firms in the Southeast for years and we’re currently Ranked in the Top 10 offices within the entire Century 21 System.</p>

<p>My Business Partner, Greg Harrelson, and I were consistently selling 150+ properties each year with our own teams, and we wanted to expand access to the systems and coaching opportunities that we know help agents grow their business. In 2014 we launched Century 21 Expert Advisors.</p>

<p>We knew there was a niche of agents in the Charleston Market that we could serve. We set out to be the best solution for agents that are committed to reaching their financial goals by growing their business. Our goal will never be to have a 200 agent office. We want to know each one of our agents personally, so we can connect with their goals and help them achieve levels of success they never knew were possible. We also know that many times agents are lured into the smaller boutique offices because they don’t want to simply be another license # for the office they choose, but often times they find themselves sacrificing the systems and support with the smaller offices because with smaller operations it can be difficult for the ownership and management to re-invest in tools for their agents.</p>

<p>We are committed to offering the best of both worlds to our agents. We’re a smaller close knit group where you get the family and team atmosphere, along with one on one coaching from our leadership team (including Greg and I). Better yet, because our office is part of The Harrelson Group Family we also offer world class technology, training, ongoing coaching and systems that you will not find with any other office in the Charleston Market that is our size. WE GUARANTEE IT!</p>

<p>If you want to be more than a number in your office, if you want to grow YOUR BRAND, and YOUR NAME in this market instead of being on someone’s “TEAM” and helping make their dreams come true, or if you simply know you’re committed to being successful in this business and just haven’t found the right fit, let’s talk.</p>
